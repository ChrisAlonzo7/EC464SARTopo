## Executive Summary
Search and rescue teams need GPS tracking collars for their dogs that work in all weather conditions, track multiple dogs at once, and can tell when a dog has found something. Currently, most GPS tracking devices on the market are designed for recreational use and are limited to tracking one collar at a time. This is not practical for search and rescue teams that have several trained dogs working together to find evidence. 
We have created a collar that is equipped with GPS and Bluetooth capabilities, as well as specific functionality that will alert the handler when a dog has found evidence. All of this information will be mapped to a mobile application accessible to everyone on the search team. The application is compatible with SARTopo, a mapping platform used by the Yavapai County Search and Rescue Team in Arizona. By connecting the collar's GPS information with SARTopo, handlers can track the location of each dog in real-time and create a visual map of the search area, as well as analyze activity and location data after each search. Overall, our solution will streamline the search and rescue process, ultimately making it more efficient and accurate.
